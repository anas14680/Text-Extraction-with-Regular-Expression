# Text-Extraction-with-Regular-Expression

The repository contains 3 python files. Each one contains a regular expression that extracts a particular pattern from a text. Each file also contains test cases to assess how effective the regex is. The files are named as follows.
* name.py: The regex in this file tries to assess whether a given string is a full name or not.
* gerund.py: A gerund is defined as a word ending in “ing” and including at least one vowel beforehand. A vowel is defined as A, E, I, O, U, or Y preceded by
a (non-Y) consonant. This regular expression aims to extract all gerunds from within a text. 
* capturing_groups.py: This regular expression aims to extract a capturing group (including named capturing groups) from within another regular expression.
